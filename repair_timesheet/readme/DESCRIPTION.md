This module integrates timesheet tracking with repair orders. It adds a "Timesheets" tab to the repair order form, allowing users to log and track the time spent on each repair through timesheet entries. Users can record detailed timesheet data, such as the project, task, date, and duration for each repair. Additionally, the module automatically calculates the total hours spent on repairs and displays this information in both the form view and the list view of repair orders.
