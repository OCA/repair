This module integrates timesheet tracking with repair orders. It adds a
"Timesheets" tab to the repair order form, allowing users to log and
track the time spent on each repair through timesheet entries. Users can
record detailed timesheet data, such as the project, task, date, and
duration for each repair. Additionally, the module automatically
calculates the total hours spent on repairs and displays this
information in both the form view and the list view of repair orders.

Usage
=====

When creating or editing a repair order, you will find a new Timesheets
tab within the repair order form. In this tab, you can log and track the
time spent on the repair by adding timesheet entries. Each entry allows
you to specify the project, task, date, and the time spent on the repair
in hours and minutes.
