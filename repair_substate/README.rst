Usage
=====

1. | Go to \*\* Settings > Technical > Sub State Configuration \*\* and
     Add "Base Substate".
   | If necessary you can add "Target State values" (ex define a
     substate for "cancel" state). Substate sequence is very important.

2. Create a repair order and check if the substate are displayed on the
   header of form view. Check if you can't set substate defined for
   repair if repair is draft.
