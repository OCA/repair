This module enhances the repair process by adding the ability to
transfer a repaired product to a specified destination location upon
completion of the repair. It introduces a Product Destination Location
field in the repair order, which defines where the repaired product will
be transferred. The default value for this field is set from the Default
Product Destination Location field of the associated Operation Type.

Upon the completion of a repair order, an additional stock move is
automatically created to transfer the repaired product to the specified
destination location.

Usage
=====

How to use this module:

1. Create a Repair Order: - Navigate to Repairs > Orders. - Click to
   create a new repair order. - Before confirming the repair, go to the
   Miscellaneous tab to view or modify the Product Destination Location
   field. This is the location where the repaired product will be
   transferred after the repair is completed. By default, this field is
   populated from the Default Product Destination Location field of the
   associated Operation Type.
2. After confirming the Repair Order: - Click on the Product Moves
   action button to view the stock movements. You will see two stock
   moves: one related to the repair itself, and another related to the
   transfer of the repaired product to the specified destination
   location.

To ensure visibility of the location-related fields, make sure your user
is added to the Technical / Manage Multiple Stock Locations group.
