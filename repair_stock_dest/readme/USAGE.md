How to use this module:

  1. Create a Repair Order:
    - Navigate to Repairs > Orders.
    - Click to create a new repair order.
    - Before confirming the repair, go to the Miscellaneous tab to view or modify the Product Destination Location field. This is the location where the repaired product will be transferred after the repair is completed. By default, this field is populated from the Default Product Destination Location field of the associated Operation Type.
  2. After confirming the Repair Order:
    - Click on the Product Moves action button to view the stock movements. You will see two stock moves: one related to the repair itself, and another related to the transfer of the repaired product to the specified destination location.

To ensure visibility of the location-related fields, make sure your user is added to the Technical / Manage Multiple Stock Locations group.
