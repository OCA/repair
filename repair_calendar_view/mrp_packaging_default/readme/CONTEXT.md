In certain businesses, it is important to know the packaging you will use to
manufacture a product. Example: food wholesale companies.

For example, imagine you want to create a food basket that includes, among
other things, 1 kg of cheese. It is not the same to put it in small sliced and
vacuum-packed 100g packages as it is to put a whole cheese ball. Even when the
product and the total weight are the same: 1kg of cheese.
