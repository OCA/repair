This module allows and encourages the use of packaging within MRP, both
to manufacture products or to create kits.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In certain businesses, it is important to know the packaging you will
use to manufacture a product. Example: food wholesale companies.

For example, imagine you want to create a food basket that includes,
among other things, 1 kg of cheese. It is not the same to put it in
small sliced and vacuum-packed 100g packages as it is to put a whole
cheese ball. Even when the product and the total weight are the same:
1kg of cheese.

If you are interested in this module, you may also be interested in
``sale_packaging_default``.

Configuration
=============

To see the effects of this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Settings*.
2. Activate *Inventory > Products > Product Packagings*.
3. Optionally, activate also *Units of Measure*. This is not required,
   but if you are interested in this module, it's probably because you
   use this.
4. Save.

Usage
=====

Some component products must exist. Those components will be later
included in the manufactured or kit product. Then, you'll notice the
module effects.

To create the component products:

1. Go to *Inventory > Products > Products*.
2. Create a product.
3. Configure its unit of measure (if you enabled that option).
4. Add some line(s) in *Inventory > Packaging*.

To use this module with **a kit of products**, you need to:

1.  Go to *Inventory > Products > Products*.
2.  Create a product that will be the kit.
3.  Set *Product Type* "Consumable".
4.  Configure its unit of measure (if you enabled that option).
5.  Enable *Inventory > Operations > Routes > Manufacture*.
6.  Click on *Bill of Materials* button and create a new one.
7.  Set *BoM Type* "Kit".
8.  Configure the rest of the BoM. When you configure the component
    lines, use the new *Packaging* and *Packaging Qty* fields.
9.  Go to *Inventory > Delivery Orders (three dots) > New > Planned
    Transfer*.
10. Fill the *Delivery Address*.
11. Add one *Operations* line with the kit product you just created.
12. Click on *Mark as TODO*.
13. You will notice that the kit has been replaced by its components,
    and each component line includes the packaging and its qty, just
    like you configured them in the BoM.

To use it with **a manufactured product**, instead:

1.  Go to *Inventory > Products > Products*.
2.  Create a product; the one that will be manufactured.
3.  Set *Product Type* "Storable Product".
4.  Configure its unit of measure (if you enabled that option).
5.  Enable *Inventory > Operations > Routes > Manufacture*.
6.  Click on *Bill of Materials* button and create a new one.
7.  Set *BoM Type* "Manufacture this product".
8.  Configure the rest of the BoM. When you configure the component
    lines, use the new *Packaging* and *Packaging Qty* fields.
9.  Go back to the product form.
10. Click on *Reordering Rules* button and create a new one.
11. Set some minimal and maximal quantities.
12. Click on *Order Once*. If you don't see this button, you can also go
    to *Inventory > Operations > Run Scheduler > Run Scheduler*.
13. Go to *Manufacturing > Operations > Manufacturing Orders*. You will
    see a new MO created from the reordering rule. Open it.
14. See how the *Components* lines contain packaging information, just
    like you defined it in the BoM. The same would happen if you created
    the MO manually.
